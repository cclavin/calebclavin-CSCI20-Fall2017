The computer randomly selects a number between 1-100
The user begins with 10 points

The user guesses a number between 1-100

If the guessed number is higher than the selected number, then the program
  indicates to guess lower and the user may not guess higher than their 
  guessed number
If the guessed number is lower than the selected number, then the program
  indicates to guess higher and the user may not guess lower than their 
  guessed number
If the guessed number is correct, then the user does not lose points and the
  total points left is displayed.
  
After a failed guess the user loses 1 point from the amount they have at the 
  beginning of the "guess"

Repeat lines 7-15 until the user guesses correctly or until there are 0 points 
  remaining
